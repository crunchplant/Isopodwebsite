                <p>Margret Markley, who also goes by Maggie, was born August 7th, 2001. Discovering her interest in the arts at a young age, she quickly delved into the world of imagination and rhetoric. She always knew from a young age that she viewed the world from what seemed like a different state than everyone around her, and the best way to convey these observations and viewpoints was to create them herself. She started to pursue her craft seriously in the 8th grade. In highschool she took interest in leading Art Club, National Art Honor Society, school murals, and the AP art courses offered. After two years in the courses she had completed 4 murals and a score of 5 on her AP art exam. She continues to pursue her talent in college with a minor in studio art, and hopes to implement these skills after school.</p>
